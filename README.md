Synopsis: This page is a collection of works by me, and also includes my resume. I intend to use this page to dynamically update
the contents as more work is done throughout my time of learning Computer Science, and to showcase my work in a meaningful way in hopes of giving it to potential employers.

All HTML/JS/CSS code was written by me, except for the template for the page, which Jumbotron Bootstrap was used. The snow effect written in JS on the visualization page was also borrowed, but is cited within the snow.js file.
